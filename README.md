# Face-Mask-Classifer
## Description
Face-Mask-Classifier is an advanced image classification project designed to distinguish between three classes: 'Incorrectly_worn_mask', 'Masked', and 'without_mask'. This model stands out for its ability to detect incorrectly worn masks, a feature rarely found in similar models, addressing class imbalance using SMOTE. Additionally, it offers high accuracy and robustness thanks to techniques like data augmentation and transfer learning using DenseNet201. This project is essential for ensuring safety and compliance in various environments, such as hospitals, factories, schools, and public transport.

## Features
Unique Classification: Detects 'Incorrectly_worn_mask', a rare and valuable feature.
High Accuracy: Leveraging DenseNet201 for transfer learning to enhance model performance.
Real-time Prediction: Provides real-time predictions for uploaded images.
SMOTE for Class Imbalance: Implements Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address class imbalance, ensuring the model is well-trained across all classes.
Data Augmentation: Uses data augmentation techniques to enhance the training dataset and improve model robustness.
End-to-End Solution: Comprehensive workflow from image collection to full deployment as a web application  using this link  https://facemask-app.onrender.com. 

## Importance of Face Mask Models
Face mask detection models are crucial in various environments to ensure safety and health compliance:

Hospitals: Ensures that healthcare workers and patients are wearing masks correctly to prevent the spread of infections.
Factories: Protects workers in manufacturing settings where mask compliance is essential for safety.
Schools: Helps maintain health standards among students and staff.
Public Transport: Ensures mask compliance in crowded spaces, reducing the risk of disease transmission.
Offices: Promotes a safe working environment by monitoring mask usage among employees.
